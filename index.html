        <h1><strong>"Tears of Blue and Gold"</strong></h1>
        <h2><strong><em>A Poem by Lucas Alven</em></strong></h2>
        <p>As rain falls down from the sky<br>I remember my past with Blue tears in my eye</p>
        <p>A past where I never felt like enough<br>Looking back those times were tough</p>
        <p>Feelings of numbness were crappy<br>As I navigated to find what was happy</p>
        <p>I suffered through that pain<br>But I must not take that time in vain</p>
        <p>Because past feelings can make you want to run away<br>But they are actually what make you stronger today</p>
        <p>As the sun always clears the rain<br>The same can be said of pain</p>
        <p>Those feelings begin to seem old<br>Now I have tears of joy that are Gold</p>
        <p>I have finally found my place<br>Crossed the line of this endless race</p>
        <p>No longer do I feel alone<br>Anxiety fades from within my bones</p>
        <p>So now all here have been told<br>This is the story of my tears that are Blue and Gold</p>
